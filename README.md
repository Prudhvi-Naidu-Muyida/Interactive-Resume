# prudhvi-interactive-resume

This is a minimal React + Vite prototype for an interactive resume for *Prudhvi Naidu*.
It was autogenerated and pre-filled with the resume content you provided. Some fields (email, LinkedIn, GitHub, project links, photo) are placeholders — provide them to fully personalize the site.

## What is included
- Minimal React app (single-file component `src/InteractiveResume.jsx`)
- Basic CSS (`src/styles.css`)
- `package.json` with start/build scripts using Vite

## How to run locally
1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended).
2. In the project folder, run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Open the local dev URL shown by Vite.

## How to build for production
```bash
npm run build
# then serve the 'dist' folder (or deploy to Vercel / Netlify / GitHub Pages)
```

## Deploy options
- **Vercel**: Create an account at Vercel, connect your GitHub repo, and deploy — it will auto-detect the Vite app.
- **GitHub Pages**: Build (`npm run build`) and push the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch (extra config required).
- **Netlify**: Drag & drop the `dist` folder or connect repo for automatic deploy.

## Next steps I can help with
- Replace placeholders with your photo, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
- Add real project links and screenshots.
- Add a 30-second intro video embed.
- Prepare a ZIP with this project and instructions (already included).
